# Hand-Painted Terminal
Minimal code for full-screen text "painting" in the terminal with fast
full-screen refresh.

This is just a few hundred lines of code meant as an example, or to be
copied and pasted rather than to be linked as a library.

A simple "make" will compile the demo, a simple color-cycling fractal
noise animation.
